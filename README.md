## <br /> 👉 Description
Sample iOS project built by <b>SwiftUI + MVVM</b> and <b>Combine(Apple's new reactive Framework)</b> using Marvel API.  <br /> <br />


## 🚀 About Combine  
Combine framework was presented at WWDC2019. This is an obvious competitor to <b>RxSwift.</b> <br /> 

This new reactive framework provides a declarative Swift API for processing values over time. Or, as Apple puts it, it’s a way for iOS developers to ‘customize (the) handling of asynchronous events by combining event-processing operators’.<br /> <br />

## 📖 Architecuture
In this project we use MVVM.

Our View is binded to a ViewModel and notify it with all user interecations. The ViewModel request to our Data Provides such as Services or Repository to fetch data by using locale database or <b> my MarvelAPI module </b> and then return to our ViewModel that information.
